Numbers
Computers can understand much more than just strings  of text. Python has a few numeric data types.
It has multiple ways of storing numbers. Which one you use depends on your intended purpose for
the number you are saving. An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and
contains all counting numbers (1, 2, 3, …) as well as their negative counterparts and the number 0.
If you were counting the number of people in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the
number of keys on a keyboard you would likely use an integer.
A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional
quantities as well as precise measurements. If you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall,
calculating the average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball player’s batting
average for the 1998 season you would likely use a float.
Numbers can be assigned to variables or used literally in a program:

an_int = 2
a_float = 2.1

print(an_int + 3)
 Output: 5

Above we defined an integer and a float as the variables an_int and a_float.
We printed out the sum of the variable an_int with the number 3. We call the number 3 here a
literal, meaning it’s actually the number 3 and not a variable with the number 3 assigned to it.
Floating-point numbers can behave in some unexpected ways due to how computers store them.
