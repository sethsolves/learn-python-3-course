Python is a programming language. Like other languages, it gives us a way to communicate ideas. 
In the case of a programming language, these ideas are “commands” that people use to communicate 
with a computer!
We convey our commands to the computer by writing them in a text file using a programming language. 
These  files are called programs. Running a program means telling a computer to read the text file, 
translate it to the set of operations that it understands, and perform those actions. 
This is a multi-line string literal
